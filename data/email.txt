My goal has always been to learn new and interesting people in a foreign environment,
to solve new problems, get new experience in the life and work and
to find a job where I can continue to not only make an adequate wage for my efforts and
qualifications, but also feel proud of and challenged by my work,
and team up with a group of people I can respect.


I am looking forward to hearing from you!

Cordially,
Anatolii.

  My goal has always been to learn new and interesting people in a foreign environment, to solve new problems, get new experience in the life and work and to find
  a job where I can continue to not only make an adequate wage for my efforts and qualifications, but also feel proud of and challenged by my work, and team up
  with a group of people I can respect.
</p>
<p>I am looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>Cordially,<br>Anatolii.</p>
